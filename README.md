# AtliQ-Finance-Report---Excel-Project
Built a Sales &amp; Finance report in Excel using Power Query and Pivot Tables, automating processes by 50%. Used DAX and Power Pivot for profitability and trend analysis, enabling leadership to make strategic, data-driven decisions.


**Project Details**
At Atliq Hardware, they needed a way to analyze their sales and financial performance across multiple fiscal years, using a dataset of around 800,000 rows.

My task was to develop a Sales & Finance Analytics report that would help them track key metrics like Net Sales, COGS, and Gross Margin, while also automating data processes for quicker insights.

I used Power Query to automate the data cleaning, saving about 4 hours of manual effort. Then, I created a data model in Power Pivot and wrote DAX measures to calculate dynamic financial metrics. I built pivot-based reports to analyze P&L by fiscal year, performance vs targets, and market/product analysis.

This automation reduced data processing time by 50%, allowed the business to make faster, data-driven decisions, and improved resource allocation based on real-time insights.
